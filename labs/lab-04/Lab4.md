<b>3.  Why is it important to choose a LICENSE? </b> </br>

Choosing the right license allows you to control how businesses can use your software. Open source licenses allow for reuse of your code while retaining copyright, and it's important to choose one because it allows you to define how your work is used and redistributed. It holds everyone legally responsible for using the work appropriately.

<b>4. Why is it important you shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license? </b> </br>

Licenses are important because they establish standards and people interacting with open source software are legally responsible for complying with terms. If a project doesn't have a license, it will automatically be under exclusive copyright, and no one can collaborate without potentially being penalized. If other contributors contribute to your unlicensed work, they can then threaten you with legal action if you try to distribute or modify the code.

<b> 5. Why the web beat Gopher: Do you agree with this claim? </b> </br>

I agree with Richard Gabriel's claim and the idea that developers should release their software to the public early in the process. Gopher's model impeded collaboration and was inefficient compared to the Web. Creating open source software and releasing work early in development allows for greater contributions from users, who will be invested in improving the product they're using. Open source software benefits from 

<b>6. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Android).</b> </br>

Android is an open source mobile operating system, and runs on the Linux kernel, which uses GPL. Althought it was using the GPL, the GPL v2 does not force a program running on top of a GPL operating system to be GPL, so Android was free to choose the license they wanted to use. <sup>1</sup> 

Android began as an operating system for digital cameras but expanded and was eventually acquired by Google. At Google, a team developed a platform powered by the Linux kernel, and as an open source software it was meant to be a flexible and upgradeable system. The official design philosophy behind Android is that apps should be built like apps on the web, without strict rules, and encourages open source development. <sup>2</sup> The team at Google  a series of hardware and software partners and emphasized they were open to collaboration, true to the open source philosophy of the project. <sup>3</sup> Although they were not restricted to using a particular license (although the kernel uses GPL), using the the Apache License makes sense for an open source operating system that emphasizes freedom in development.
