2. * Make sure that your answers are simple and thorough - if the person is a beginner, avoid being alienating or condensing. <br/>
   * Do not be afraid to ask further clarifying questions of the person asking, especially if the original question is unclear. Be sure to answer all parts of their question. <br/>

3. This chapter follows the story of Jesse Jordan, a student at RPI who took advantage of the established intranet and used Microsoftâ€™s network file system to build an index of all the files available within the RPI network. The article emphasized that the student's work was harmless, and that he did not intentionally collect a quarter of a million songs in his directory. All he had done was manipulate pre-existing software to files uploaded on the RPI intranet. It doesn't make sense to me why the RIAA would double-down on suing a student who was not making money off of the media accessed through his search engine. As a reader, we're supposed to take away that Jesse is incorrectly and aggressively targeted for using public software to create a public directory of public information, and that the RIAA is overstepping a boundary by interfering with this student's public project. It seems that there must be more to the story -- it seems irrational that the RIAA would go to such lengths to get $12,000 from a student and also have him barred from working with media technology for the rest of his career. Even if the goal of the RIAA is to make an example of the student, there must be better examples of software developers actively downloading and distributing protected msuic. There must be standards put in place to protect students and young developers from big corporations like the RIAA.

After looking into different open source projects, I have realized that I would prefer to work on software used in neuroscience or cognitive science labs, and one such project is Psychopy. PsychoPy is an open source software package, written in Python programming language, that can be used to create experiments for neuroscience and experimental psychology. I'm familiar with the user interface through cognitive science research, and it would be nice to contribute to the backend. Their issue tracker has some issues labelled "beginner" and "not time-sensitive", so it should be easy to get involved with it!
I also want to investiage OpenNeuroOrg, an open platform for analyzing and sharing neuroimaging data, but it seems like a more complicated codebase that would require more time to become familiar with. I hope I can take the time to get more familiar with it and potentially contribute at some point during the semester!
